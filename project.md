Turtle Trading is a famous trend-following trading strategy developed by Richard Dennis and William Eckhardt in the 1980s.

Combining Python programming with Turtle Trading can be a powerful approach to automate and enhance your trading strategy. Python provides a wide range of libraries and tools for data analysis, algorithmic trading, and connecting to financial markets.

Here's a general overview of how you can use Python for Turtle Trading:

1. Data Analysis: Python has excellent libraries for data analysis, such as pandas and NumPy. You can use these libraries to import and manipulate financial data, calculate indicators, and identify trading signals.

2. Strategy Implementation: Once you have defined the rules of your Turtle Trading strategy, you can use Python to code those rules into a trading system. You can write functions or classes that execute the entry and exit signals based on the strategy's rules.

3. Backtesting: Python provides tools like backtrader and Zipline for backtesting your trading strategy on historical data. These libraries allow you to simulate trades and evaluate the performance of your strategy over time.

4. Real-time Trading: To execute trades in real-time, you can use Python libraries that connect to brokers or financial APIs. Some popular choices include the Interactive Brokers API, Alpaca API, or the MetaTrader API.

5. Risk Management and Portfolio Optimization: Python can also help you with risk management techniques and portfolio optimization. Libraries like scipy and scikit-learn can assist in calculating risk metrics, portfolio allocations, and other risk-related analysis.

Remember that trading involves risks, and it's important to thoroughly test and validate your strategy before deploying it with real money. Additionally, make sure to adhere to any regulatory requirements and consider seeking professional advice if needed.

Overall, using Python for Turtle Trading can streamline your trading process, automate repetitive tasks, and provide you with powerful analytical capabilities.

## Average True Range: 
True range = Maximum(high - low, high - previous day's close, previous day's close - low)\
TR1 = High - low\
TR2 = High - previous day's close\
TR3 = previous day's close - low\
For **ATR** we will consider Average of True Range of past **20** days.

## Position Size
In the context of trading equities in the Indian stock market, calculating Dollar Risk involves determining the amount of money you're willing to risk on a single trade. The process generally includes the following steps:

1. **Determine Account Size**: The total capital available in your trading account.
2. **Trading_Amount**: For buying Multiple type of shares we will divide our capital.
3. **Set Risk Percentage per Trade**: The percentage of your account size that you're willing to risk on each trade. A common rule of thumb is 1-2%.
4. **Calculate Dollar Risk**: Multiply the account size by the risk percentage.

### Example Calculation:

1. **Account Size**: ₹1,00,000 
2. **Trading_Amount**: ₹1,00,000/2 = ₹50,000
3. **Risk Percentage per Trade**: 1%

### Risk:
Risk = Trading_Amount × ( Risk Percentage / 100)

This means you're willing to risk ₹500 on each trade.

#### First Buy
Unit = Risk // ATR --This will give you No. of stocks to buy based on volatality.

## Stop Loss Calculation:
Stop Loss = Entry Price - (2 × ATR)


# Understanding the Levels

Richard Dennis' **Turtle Trading Levels** are essential for managing position sizes and risk exposure. Below is a more detailed breakdown with practical insights on each level to help you apply the strategy effectively.

---

## Level 1: Single Market (Max 4 Units)
### Objective: 
Control risk by limiting exposure to any one asset.

**What it means:**  
Even if a stock (e.g., TCS) shows strong trends, you can only buy up to 4 units. Each unit is a set of shares bought at different points (as part of pyramiding).

**Rationale:**  
This prevents overexposure to a single asset. Even if the stock moves favorably, the rules limit greed and encourage disciplined trading.

**Example:**
- Assume ₹1,00,000 capital with **1% risk** = ₹1,000 per trade.
- Buy 4 batches of shares, but each batch must align with the 1% risk rule (e.g., based on ATR).

---

## Level 2: Closely Correlated Markets (Max 6 Units)
### Objective: 
Manage risk when markets are highly correlated.

**What it means:**  
If two stocks (e.g., Reliance and ONGC) are from the same sector or move together, you can only hold up to 6 units across both.

**Why?**  
Correlated stocks behave similarly—both could rise or fall simultaneously, amplifying risks or profits. Limiting exposure protects you from unexpected market downturns.

**Example:**
- **Reliance:** 3 units  
- **ONGC:** 3 units

If both stocks perform poorly, your losses are capped by the 6-unit rule.

---

## Level 3: Loosely Correlated Markets (Max 10 Units)
### Objective: 
Allow more flexibility with markets that have low correlation.

**What it means:**  
If two stocks belong to different sectors (e.g., TCS in technology and HDFC in banking), you can take up to 10 units across them. These markets aren’t likely to move in lockstep.

**Benefit:**  
You can diversify your portfolio and potentially benefit from trends in multiple sectors.

**Example:**
- **TCS:** 4 units  
- **HDFC:** 6 units  

Even if one sector suffers, the impact is limited due to diversification.

---

## Level 4: Single Direction – Long or Short (Max 12 Units)
### Objective: 
Prevent overexposure to one market direction.

**What it means:**  
You can only hold 12 units across all your positions in a single direction—either all **long** (buy) or all **short** (sell). This avoids the risk of being overly committed to a bullish or bearish trend.

**Example:**
- **Long:** 12 units (across multiple stocks)  
OR  
- **Short:** 12 units (if short-selling is part of your strategy)

**Reason:**  
If the market reverses unexpectedly, a concentrated long or short position could lead to substantial losses. This rule ensures you can exit safely if trends change.

## Chosen Strategy: Level 2 - Closely Correlated Markets (Max 6 Units)

We will follow **Level 2: Closely Correlated Markets (Max 6 Units)**, i.e., **3 units for each type**.

---

# Pyramiding

1. **First Entry:**  
   Buy **1 unit**. The stop loss for this entry will be:  
   **Stop Loss** = Entry Price - (2 × ATR)

2. **Second Pyramid Entry:**  
   If the stock increases by **1/2 ATR**, purchase another unit.  
   - **Second Entry Price** = Entry Price + 1/2 ATR  
   - **Stop Loss** = Previous Stop Loss + 1/2 ATR

3. **Third Pyramid Entry:**  
   If the stock increases by **1/2 ATR** from the previous level, purchase a third unit.  
   - **Third Entry Price** = Entry Price + 1/2 ATR  
   - **Stop Loss** = Previous Stop Loss + 1/2 ATR

---

# Exits

- **Exit Rule:**  
  Exit the position when the stock reaches a **20-day low**.
