# Turtle Trading Strategy Overview

Turtle Trading is a famous trend-following strategy developed by **Richard Dennis** and **William Eckhardt** in the 1980s. 

Combining **Python programming** with Turtle Trading can enhance your trading strategy by automating tasks. Python offers powerful tools for data analysis, algorithmic trading, and real-time market connectivity.

## How to Use Python for Turtle Trading

1. **Data Analysis**:  
   Use Python libraries like **pandas** and **NumPy** to import and manipulate financial data, calculate indicators, and generate trading signals.

2. **Strategy Implementation**:  
   Define the rules of Turtle Trading and code them into functions or classes that generate entry and exit signals based on market conditions.

3. **Backtesting**:  
   Utilize libraries such as **Backtrader** or **Zipline** to simulate trades on historical data and evaluate your strategy’s performance.

4. **Real-Time Trading**:  
   Connect with financial APIs using Python libraries (e.g., **Interactive Brokers API**, **Alpaca API**, or **MetaTrader API**) to execute trades in real-time.

5. **Risk Management & Portfolio Optimization**:  
   Use **scipy** and **scikit-learn** for calculating risk metrics and optimizing portfolio allocations.

> **Note**: Trading involves risks. Ensure thorough testing and validation of your strategy and comply with regulatory requirements.

## Average True Range (ATR) Calculation

**True Range (TR)** is calculated using the following formulas:
- **TR1** = High - Low  
- **TR2** = High - Previous Close  
- **TR3** = Previous Close - Low
- **TR** = MAX(TR1,TR2,TR3)

The **ATR** is the **average of the True Range over the past 20 days**.

## Position Sizing

In the Indian stock market, calculating **Dollar Risk** helps determine the amount you’re willing to risk per trade.  

### Steps to Calculate Dollar Risk:
1. **Determine Account Size**: Total available capital.
2. **Divide Trading Amount**: Split the capital for multiple trades.
3. **Set Risk Percentage per Trade**: Typically **1-2%** of total capital.
4. **Calculate Dollar Risk**:  
   **Dollar Risk** = Account Size × (Risk Percentage / 100)

---

### Example Calculation:

- **Account Size**: ₹1,00,000  
- **Trading Amount**: ₹1,00,000 / 2 = ₹50,000  
- **Risk Percentage per Trade**: 1%

**Risk per Trade**:  
Risk = ₹50,000 × (1 / 100) = **₹500**

**First Buy**:  
No. of units = **Risk / ATR**  
This determines the number of shares based on volatility.

## Stop Loss Calculation

**Stop Loss** = Entry Price - (2 × ATR)

# Understanding the Levels

Richard Dennis' **Turtle Trading Levels** manage position sizes and exposure effectively. Below are the four levels with practical insights.

---

## Level 1: Single Market (Max 4 Units)
### Objective: 
Control risk by limiting exposure to one asset.

- **Explanation**: Buy a maximum of 4 units in a single stock, even if the trend is strong.
- **Reason**: This prevents overexposure to a single asset and encourages disciplined trading.

**Example**:  
- **Capital**: ₹1,00,000  
- **Risk per Trade**: 1% = ₹1,000  
- Buy 4 batches of shares, with each batch following the **1% risk rule**.

---

## Level 2: Closely Correlated Markets (Max 6 Units)
### Objective: 
Manage risk when trading correlated assets.

- **Explanation**: For stocks in the same sector (e.g., **Reliance** and **ONGC**), you can hold a maximum of **6 units across both stocks**.
- **Reason**: Correlated stocks move together, increasing the risk of simultaneous losses.

**Example**:  
- **Reliance**: 3 units  
- **ONGC**: 3 units  

If both stocks underperform, your total exposure is capped at 6 units.

---

## Level 3: Loosely Correlated Markets (Max 10 Units)
### Objective: 
Allow more flexibility with markets that have low correlation.

- **Explanation**: Stocks in different sectors (e.g., **TCS** in technology and **HDFC** in banking) allow up to **10 units** in total.
- **Benefit**: This diversification helps mitigate sector-specific risks.

**Example**:  
- **TCS**: 4 units  
- **HDFC**: 6 units  

If one sector underperforms, the impact is limited by diversification.

---

## Level 4: Single Direction – Long or Short (Max 12 Units)
### Objective: 
Prevent overexposure to one market direction.

- **Explanation**: You can hold up to **12 units** in a single direction, either **all long** (buy) or **all short** (sell).
- **Reason**: Limits the risk of large losses if the market unexpectedly reverses.

**Example**:  
- **Long**: 12 units across multiple stocks  
OR  
- **Short**: 12 units (if short-selling)

---

## Chosen Strategy: Level 2 - Closely Correlated Markets (Max 6 Units)

We will follow **Level 2: Closely Correlated Markets** with a maximum of **6 units** (3 units per stock type).

# Pyramiding

1. **First Entry**:  
   Buy **1 unit**.  
   - **Stop Loss** = Entry Price - (2 × ATR)

2. **Second Pyramid Entry**:  
   If the stock increases by **1/2 ATR**, buy another unit.  
   - **Second Entry Price** = Entry Price + 1/2 ATR  
   - **Stop Loss** = Previous Stop Loss + 1/2 ATR

3. **Third Pyramid Entry**:  
   If the stock increases by **1/2 ATR** from the previous level, buy a third unit.  
   - **Third Entry Price** = Entry Price + 1/2 ATR  
   - **Stop Loss** = Previous Stop Loss + 1/2 ATR

# Exits

- **Exit Rule**:  
  Exit the position when the stock reaches a **20-day low**.
